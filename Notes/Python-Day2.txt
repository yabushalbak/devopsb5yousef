A variable in programming is like a container where we 
can store the data.

why do we use variables?

1. Storage
    Variables allow us to store data that we can use and modify
    later.
2. Readability
    Makes our code easier to understand, debug and find what the 
    data represents
    * debug mostly means going over the code again for the purpose of
    understanding or finding the mistake
3. Reusability
    Once the value is stored in a variable, you can use that variable
    multiple times in different parts of your code.

Formula of The Variable Creation
    variablename = value

Naming A Variable
    Rules:
        *Variable name cannot start with a number.
        *It cannot have spaces.
        *It can only contain alphanumeric charecters and underscore(_).
            *alphanumeric: numbers and letters
        *Variable names are case sensative which means
        'age' is not the same as 'Age'. 

Naming Conventions
    *Convention -> how do you name the variable.

There are 4 different types of naming conventions:

    1. Camel Case
        Naming starts with a lower case and capitalizes each word after that.
        Ex: firstName, lastName, areaCode etc.
        Notes: Most of java, javascript users
    
    2. Pascal Case
        Naming starts with an upper case and capitalizes each word after that
        Ex: FirstName, LastName, AreaCode etc.

    3. Snake Case
        Each word in a variable name is seperated by underscore (_).
        Ex: first_name, last_name, area_code etc.
        Note:Most of python users.
    
    4. Kebab Case
        Each word in a variable name is seperated by hyphen (-).
        Ex: first-name, last-name, area-code etc.

NOTE: When creating a variable type of variable is auto understood
by python.

Type of Numerical Variables
    1. Integer: Represents whole numbers.
        Ex: age = 25
    2. Float: Represents real numbers. (Numbers with decimal paints.)
        Ex: weight= 190.4 , avg = 8.0
    3. Complex: Represents complex numbers that has both
        Imaginary and real parts.
        Ex: 5 + 4j -> is the real part 4j is the imaginary part

Type Function
    The type() function is a built-in Python function
    used to determine the data type of a variable.
        Ex: a = 10
            print(type(a)) #Output <class 'int'>
            b = 10.1
            print(type(b)) #output <class 'float'>
    Importance:
        Helps debugging
        Useful when learning because it helps you to
        understand how python works with data types

Creating Multiple Variables In Single Line
    We can define miltiple variables on a single line,
    by seperating them with commas(,).
        Syntax: a,b,c = 1.1 , 1 , "h"


    Advantage:
        Reduce the line of your code.
        More readable
        Compact code

Assigning Multiple Variables With A Same value
    Ex: a = b = c = d = 5
        #in the line above variable a, b, c and d will
        #be assigned with a value 5 and type of all Variables
        #will be integer. 

ReAssignment in Python
    AFter variabless assigned with a value, we can also
    assign a new value to them.
    Ex: var1 = 6
        var1 = "d"
        var1 = 1.0
        var1 = 5 + 1j
