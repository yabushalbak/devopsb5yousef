#Create a program that will find each digit just using
# the variable name. 
# One fact is that number is always going to be 4 digit.

# Note! Every time finding a remainder with 10 gives us 
# last digit from the number. 
#Note! Every time a number is divided by 10 will 
# lose its last digit. 
# Find the remainder with 10 which will give last digit
# since the last digit is found then remove it by dividing
# 10
